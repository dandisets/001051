description: "This dataset was collected at the Allen Institute. It includes data
  from 99 electrophysiology sessions featuring multi-Neuropixel recordings throughout
  the left hemisphere while mice performed a visual change detection task. This dataset
  is closely related to the Allen Institute Visual Behavior Neuropixels (VBN) dataset,
  but differs in two important ways: \nFirst, whereas the VBN recordings were focused
  on visual cortical areas and underlying subcortical regions, this dataset features
  recordings from throughout the left hemisphere, including frontal and medial cortical
  areas and the striatum. \nSecond, we have modified the behavioral task for this
  dataset to experimentally manipulate task engagement. During the VBN recordings,
  an hour of active behavior was followed by a passive behavior block during which
  the lick spout was retracted and mice were presented with the same visual stimuli
  but now with no opportunity to lick for reward. In practice, mice often satiated
  before the passive block. For this dataset, we interposed a 'no-reward' block in
  the middle of active behavior. During this new epoch, the lick spout remained extended
  but licks for visual changes no longer triggered reward. At the end of the no-reward
  block, auto-rewards were given to indicate that rewards were once again available,
  and many mice resumed licking for changes.\n\nTo better understand how to access
  and analyze this dataset, we encourage potential users to refer to the following
  resources:\n\n1) This repository includes a quick-start tutorial notebook as well
  as metadata tables for the sessions, probes, channels and units included in this
  dataset: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SHIELD_Dynamic_Gating_Analysis\n2) To
  learn more about the basic visual change detection task as well as the general structure
  of the nwb files, consult the documentation available for the Allen Observatory
  Visual Behavior Neuropixels dataset here: https://portal.brain-map.org/circuits-behavior/visual-behavior-neuropixels\n\nThis
  dataset was used in the following preprint: \nSHIELD: Skull-shaped hemispheric implants
  enabling large-scale-electrophysiology datasets in the mouse brain [https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.12.566771]"
